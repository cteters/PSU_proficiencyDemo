# About 

This is an assortment of files meant to be used as a sandbox for preparation toward taking a live coding examination that is hosted at PSU,  as part of the requirements for taking upper division computer science courses as an undergraduate in the program. The coding exercises found here are meant to challenge a person's coding ability and understanding of many popular data structures, but also a proficiency in the use of a terminal based text editor such as VIM. It is also recommended to have some understanding in the use of GDB. 

Here is a [link](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/www.pdx.edu.computer-science/files/PSU%20Proficiency%20Exam%20Application%20Process-2016-2017.pdf) describing the proficiency exam process in greater detail.

## How these files can be used

These are the same files that can be obtained by contacting the school, or obtained by enrolling in core lower division classes, but with the addition of having comments with the style of the sort of questions that can be asked during an exam. I found that having the questions already in my codebase provided for a better workflow and is the one main perk in using this project. A straightforward approach to using these files would be to add them to a directory that can be managed through a terminal based environment and edited in a text editor such as VIM.  The provided vimconfig file can also be used to restrict use of the arrow keys as good practice for test day. Finally, Iâ€™ve also added in my own personal solutions for any that might want something to compare with.

Cheers!
